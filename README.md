# Fall2023 - Implementation in Rust of zk-SNARKs

## About

This is a semester project (200h) of Master program at [Eurecom](https://www.eurecom.fr) (Biot, France) under the instruction of professor [Antonio FAONIO](https://www.eurecom.fr/en/people/faonio-antonio).

[Project Proposal](/references/ProjectProposal-AntonioFaonio-Fall2023.pdf): This student project centers on implementing zk-SNARKs, a powerful cryptographic tool, using the Rust programming language. The project aims to demonstrate the practical application of zk-SNARKs in privacy-preserving computations, showcasing the student's proficiency in both advanced cryptography and Rust programming.

Below are more details and resources from the professor:
- The idea of the project is to implement the zkSNARKs of this paper <https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1518>
- Fortunately, we do not need to start from scratch because the paper above is based on this other paper <https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1763> for which there is already a rust implementation <https://github.com/geometryresearch/cq>


Learning Rust resources:
- [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/): An excellent resource to get started. It starts from scratch and explains the core concepts rather quickly and in great details. It covers many parts of the language and should be a very good starting point for anyone willing to learn rust.

- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings): In complement to the link above. It contains various exercises to train while reading the book. There are a lot of them and it is not so useful to do all of them, but it can help  to experiment with the most tricky concepts of the language.

- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/#rust-by-example): Shows most of the concepts of Rust through examples. It should also be used in addition to the first link, to understand better some ideas with concrete examples.

- [The Rust Reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/introduction.html): A reference book to have to use in last resort if everything above failed. Very useful for very specific things, otherwise the first book should be enough most of the time.
